This game was created during the Global Game Jam 2017 in just 48 Hours. The theme has been "waves". 

Our main goal with this game was to combine the many different perceptions people have about the word "waves". One could interpret "waves" as water, different stages in a game or even music. We focused our game on two of these ideas. On the one hand you got the enemies spawning in waves, on the other you got the music that will influence the weapon you need in order to get rid of them. Collectables like an extra life, slow motion or even one that will transform your enemies in to easy targets will help you on your journey.

I participated via the SRH University Heidelberg's Jam Site. Since I was completely new to game jams in general, it had to find people to work with. Fortunately the university provided enough resources to get to know each other. Because the other members of my team had little to no experience in coding via Unity's API we decided that I will implement the game's code on my own.
